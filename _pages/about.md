My research focuses on what leads and motivates people to harm others. To examine this, I study emotions, antisociality, and psychopathology in children and youth.

### What does it look like when aggression and suicidality co-occurs in youth?

<img src='/images/Fig2.png' style="height: 450px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" align="right" > ​​In a population-based birth cohort (N = 1637), I performed a profile analysis to identify how aggression, suicidality, and emotionality patterns present in adolescents (15/17 years of age). 

Most youth (~80%) showed little to no harm towards others or themselves. Of the youth showing harm, 95% of them appears to primarily harm either themselves OR others, not both. All youth showing harm had on average higher negative emotionality, but only those showwing aggression had higher callousness. Whether suicidality co-occured with aggression seemed to depend on the severity of the youth's negative emotionality.

All youth showing either suicidality and/or aggression had parents that reported less positive parenting practices during their childhood. Youth showing aggression tended also have lower childhood household income, a more antisocial childhood best friend, and be assigned male at birth. Youth showing suicidality were more likely to have fathers showing more depression during their childhood and be assigned female at birth. 

**IMPLICATIONS:** Sucidality and aggression rarely co-occur at high levels in the general population of adolescents. Youth typically either take out their emotional pain on themselves OR others, which may depend on their level of callousness toward others. Adolescents showing minimal harm towards themselves or others typically grow up in higher income households, with parents that spend more poisitive time with them (activities, games, encouragement), have less depressed fathers, and have less antisocial best friends.

### Do genetics interact with environment to affect youth antisocial behavior? 

In a longitudinal study (N = 721), we assessed how genetic risk for antisociality (via two polygenetic risk scores; PRSa,c) and hostile environments (school violence, harsh parenting) related to stable and unstable forms of antisocial behavior (nonaggressive conduct problems, physical aggression, social aggression) across adolescence (ages 13, 15, and 17 years).

Harsh parenting, violence at school, and antisocial genetic risk were all independently associated with stable forms of antisocial behavior. We also found a consistent genetic-environment interaction specific to late adolescence:

- Higher genetic risk for antisociality: harsher parenting was associated with increased social aggression (red lines)
- Lower genetic risk for antisociality: harsher parenting was associated with decreased social aggression​ (blue lines)

<br/><img src='/images/PRSfig.png'>

Interestingly, each genetic risk score (PRSa and PRSc) showed the same genetic-environment interaction, despite each explaining separate portions of antisocial behavior. Genetic risk scores were not meaningfully correlated with one another likely due to one being derived from a primarily child sample (PRSc), while the other from a largely adult sample (PRSa). 

**IMPLICATIONS:** Harsher parenting was linked to elevated stable antisocial behaviors across adolescence. However, shifts in social aggression in late adolescence were partially explained by a consistent genetic-environment interaction (~8% of variance).

Late adolescents considered more susceptible to antisociality may respond to harsh parenting by mirroring that emotional hostility when interacting with peers. Alternately, youth less susceptible to antisociality may respond to harsh parenting in the opposite way: reducing their social aggression (i.e., abstaining from emotional bullying, isolating others, damaging relationships). Perhaps those with lower genetic risk for antisociality are more socially sensitive individuals, who withdraw from all types of social interactions (good and bad) when they feel attacked.

These interactions may only emerge in late adolescence as youth overall become better at inhibiting their base impulses, making those that cannot control their behavior easier to identify as socially divergent. More research is needed to test this hypothesis. These findings are also correlational so we cannot say for certain it is the environment that causes these changes in behaviour, it could be the other way around or a third factor.

Together this suggests that youth may respond to the same challenging environment in opposite ways depending on their susceptibility to that stressor.

### How is emotion recognition tied to cold-calculated vs hot-reactive aggression?

In two independently collected samples of children, we found that more difficulty identifying expressions of fear, anger, and sadness in others was consistently related to using goal-focused (also known as cold-calculated) aggression. Fear and anger associations with goal-focused aggression were stronger in early (ages 4-6) and middle childhood (ages 8-9), respectively. Interestingly, we found that how they misrecognised angry expressions mattered. Goal-focused aggression was tied to thinking angry expressions looked emotionless (i.e., anger insensitivity), rather than mixing up anger for another emotion. ​
<br/><img src='/images/Emotion.png' style="height: 500px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" align="left" > 

On the other hand, we thought that reactive aggression—which is typically associated with a hot-headed temperament—would link to seeing more anger in faces regardless of whether they were actually angry (i.e., an anger bias). But surprisingly, that isn’t what we found.

Instead, thinking negative expressions looked happy (i.e., a happiness bias) was consistently linked to more reactive aggression, but only in early childhood. Findings were consistent in both samples.

**IMPLICATIONS:** Children who engage in more cold-calculated aggression have greater difficulty seeing when others are in distress and are less sensitive to threat cues. Difficulty seeing that they've upset someone may allow them to stay calm and goal-focused in intense situations, making it easier for them to harm others to get what they want. 

Young children exhibiting hot-reactive aggression may be particularly sensitive to rewarding emotions leading them to see happiness when it isn’t there. Trouble figuring out the valence of an emotion (mistaking negative for positive emotions) could also be causing social blunders that result in conflict. ​​Lastly, this study was correlational, meaning we can’t say for sure whether reduced emotion recognition causes aggression in children, only that those two things seem to hang together.

### How is anger linked to violence and recidivism in youth? 
<img src='/images/Angerprofiles.png' style="height: 350px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" align="right" > ​​In a court-provided sample of justice system involved youth (N = 548), self-reported anger over the last few months did not relate to whether youth reoffended within two years. This is important information for courts to know given that many juvenile risk assessments include items measuring youths’ anger/irritability (e.g., YLS/CMI). However, characteristics of anger (i.e., fuse vs. duration) were important for their (re)offending behaviour. Among youth with a history of violent offending, reporting prolonged anger was linked to twice the odds of reoffending within 2 years. Alternatively, among youth who had a history of only nonviolent offences, reporting a short fuse was associated with 2.2 times the odds of continuing to nonviolently offend.  Gender and age (11 to 18 years) were controlled and did not moderate these relations. ​​​

Higher overall anger and/or short anger fuse was linked to current violence in justice-involved youth. Overall anger was especially tied to current violence in youth age ~14 and older, and prolonged anger was only related to current violence in youth age ~14.5 and older.

**IMPLICATIONS:** There may be two youth anger profiles that are at twice the odds of reoffending compared to their low-anger counterparts: prolonged anger-serious offenders and short fuse-nonviolent offenders. The first may represent a brooding youth capable of violence who also tends to engage in non-violent offences (like stealing). The second may represent a quick-tempered youth who tends to act on their emotions with little forethought, but it less likely to commit serious crimes. This latter repeat-offender type may be more likely to desist as they age, as emotion regulation improves with age and less serious youth offenders tend to desist offending in adulthood. 

Lastly, anger may be especially tied to current violent behaviour in older adolescents. Further research is still needed to replicate and build on the limited findings in this area. ​

### Is emotion recognition uniquely linked to aggression in children?

<img src='/images/helping2.png' style="height: 250px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" align="left" > We found that poor negative emotion recognition in children was uniquely linked to increased physical aggression, as opposed to non-aggressive externalizing symptoms (i.e., ADHD and ODD; N = 298). Age, gender, and verbal ability were controlled. 

<img src="/images/NE_agg.png" height="400px" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 20px;" align = "right">

Emotion insensitivity (thinking an unhappy face is showing no emotion) appeared to contribute more to this relation than emotion misspecifications (e.g., mistaking a fearful face for looking angry).

**​IMPLICATIONS:** Aggressive children appear to have unique difficulties in understanding others' cues of distress and hostility. Not being as sensitive to others' negative reactions may enable these youth to harm others without having to feel bad about doing so.

### How is parasympathetic nervous system activity linked to prosociality in children?

We found a goldilocks relation between children's ‘rest and digest' system (i.e., parasympathetic nervous system) and their prosociality (N = 300). Children with moderate levels of parasympathetic system activation had increased sympathy and prosocial behaviours (e.g., sharing). However, this was only the case for children in middle childhood, not early childhood. Parasympathetic system activation was indicated by children resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA).

​**IMPLICATIONS:** Children in middle childhood with under- or over-activation of their parasympathetic nervous system at rest are less prosocial.

​Those with over-activation of the 'rest and digest' system may be overly serene in the presence of a distressed other, reducing their ability/motivation to feel for and help others. Alternatively, 'under-activation' may be related to difficulty regulating one's own distress when confronted by a distressed other. Further research is needed to explore this theory.

Resting RSA has been found to increase with age, thus its influence on behaviour may increase as children age. This would explain why we did not find consistent results in early childhood.
